(todo)

  
## Instructions for subsequent website updates

After each RCF, we would like to keep a branch copy of the repository. This is so we can check through each one of our iterations for inspiration.
However to keep space within the github, we als want to delete repositories that have not been touched in awhile. Use your discretion when deleting branches of previosu years.
